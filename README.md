# The Wall Flower Company

## Start Dev

- `npm start`

## Build Site

- `npm run build`

## Netlify

Currently the wesite is deployed everytime a new PR is merged to `main` branch. So it would be good not to push directly to the main branch. Use the develop branch to work and then create a PR to merge your changes to main.

### Deploy to Netlify

- `netlify deploy` --> deploy to draft url
- `netlify deploy --prod` --> deploy to prod
